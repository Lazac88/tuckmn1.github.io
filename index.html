	<h2>My Story</h2>
	<p>
		Prior to starting the Bachelor of Information Technology I was a Physiotherapist. 
		I decided to make the jump to Information Technology because I wanted the skills to be able to develop any ideas that came to mind.
		Project 1 has been a great experience in that we are finally working with interesting technology and I am confident in my ability to work with difficult code.
		I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about APIs, backend coding, virtual reality, and android development. 
		It has solidified my understanding of where I want to work and what I want to work with.
		My confidence has drastically improved over the course of this semester, and I feel that I can tackle any problem head on.
