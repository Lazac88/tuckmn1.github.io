  <h2>Interesting Challenge 3</h2>
  <h3>Description</h3>
	<p>
		Set up ASP.NET 5/Core.
	</p>
  <h3>Process & Steps Taken:</h3>
	<p>
		ASP.NET Core is the latest version of the .NET framework. 
		I was working from visual studio 2015, which did not have the automatic set up for a Core project. 
		This meant that when I started up a Core project it would not compile straight away. 
		I also had to install additional libraries to my computer as my version of visual studio did not include Core by default.
	</p>
  <h3>Challenges:</h3>
	<p>
		The first notable challenge was installing Core and the Core tools required to set up a Core project in visual studio. 
		At the time of install I was running Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.
		I installed the Windows (x64) Core.exe, and the Visual Studio 2015 Tools that are required to make a Core application. 
		However I found that after installing both of them, I still had no options to create a Core project. 
		I tried the usual things, such as restarting the computer and checking that everything was installed correctly, to no avail. 
		I began searching the internet for a solution to this problem. 
		I eventually found a few suggestions that Core does not work well with the 2015 Community Edition, so I decided to upgrade. 
		I considered moving to Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise, but that would conflict with what we used in other classes, so I decided to use 2015 Professional. 
		Once I had that installed and running, I re-ran the Core installer and VS 2015 tools. 
		This time I had the option of creating a Core project, so I had solved my first challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second challenge with Core was that once I could create a Core project, I was unable to build it. 
		To solve this issue, I went to the Core documentation and started looking through the trouble shooting section. 
		I was unable to find a solution there. 
		The documentation was mostly geared towards VS 2017. I started looking further abroad, and found that even once Core had been installed I still had to add the dependencies and tools to the project. 
		Fortunately, our project leader had found what dependencies were required. 
		I found that trying to add them through Nuget did not work, so I had to manually type them into dependencies, and let Visual Studio update the project. 
		I also had to add Core tools to the project to build it.

  <h3>Choosen Solution:</h3>
	<p>
		Upgrade version of Visual Studio to run Core.
		Install Core.exe and Visual Studio Tools.
		Add dependencies and tools manually.
	</p>
  <h3>What I learnt:</h3>
	<p>
		I learnt a lot about Nuget and dependencies. 
		I now know how to add a library via Nuget, choose a version, and update if necessary. 
		I can manually add dependencies for a Core app using the project.json file. 
		This means if the app is opened on another machine, it will automatically add those dependencies.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have also learnt the newer isnâ€™t always better, especially straight after release. 
		Visual Studio 2015 was unable to set Core up automatically, which meant a lot of manual work was required  This is not a problem in Visual Studio 2017.
