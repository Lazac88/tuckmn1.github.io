  <h2>Interesting Challenge 4</h2>
  <h3>Description</h3>
	<p>
		Initial meeting with a client to get application specifications.
	</p>
  <h3>Process & Steps Taken:</h3>
	<p>
		Draft a formal email to send to the client.
	</p>
	<p>
		Communicate via email to arrange a suitable time and place to meet her.
	</p>
	<p>
		Discuss with the client her application idea, the specifications, and its primary purpose.
	</p>
	<p>
		Provide feedback for the client after the meeting.
	</p>
  <h3>Challenges:</h3>
	<p>
		The first challenge was writing a draft of the formal email we were to send to the client. 
		I have communicated with all forms of health professionals in the past, but it had been about three years since I last had to do so. 
		The draft came together nicely and only minor changes were required after review.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second challenge was talking to the client herself. 
		She was not very technologically savvy, but had a great deal of knowledge in her field, and many ideas of what the application would look like. 
		She had considered specifics such as screen brightness, movement patterns, and animations, but had not given much thought to what device to use, or whether it was going to be a tool used by a health professional, or patients, or both. 
		It was challenging to guide her through each aspect that we needed to consider, before coming to a solution that solved her problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		The final challenge was providing the client with a written summary of what had transpired at the meeting, and a description of what we intended to work on. 
		This was challenging because we wanted to accurately detail what we had discussed and settled upon.
	</p>
  <h3>Choosen Solution:</h3>
	<p>
		The solutions to the challenges above include: -
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Working as a team. </li>
		<li>Giving each other feedback. </li>
		<li>Prepping for the client interview, by discussing what we already know, and what we need to know.</li>
	</ul>
  <h3>What I learnt:</h3>
	<p>
		My takeaway from this experience is that I was not as confident as I use to be when meeting a stranger for the first time and discussing specifics. 
		Communication is a skill that takes practise, and it is possible to get rusty. 
		I feel that exposing myself to this sort of interaction on a regular basis will help to quickly improve my communication skills, and lead to better rapport with clients. 
		This in turn will mean I will be able to gather more information from the client, so that fewer follow-up questions will be required.
	</p>
  <h3>Evidence:</h3>
	<p>
		Email trail between our CommSoft group and our client.
	</p>
	<p>
		Summary document of what was discussed at the meeting.
	</p>
	<p>
		A finished app for our client (Production Branch in CommunitySoftware repo).
