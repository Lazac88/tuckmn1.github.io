  <h2>Interesting Challenge 1</h2>
  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Learn how to make a RESTful Web API request to Digital NZ and receive a JSON string.
    </p>
    
  <h3>Process & Steps Taken:</h3>
    <p>
      I had no prior knowledge of what a web API was, or how to use a web API when this task was assigned. 
      During the task briefing, our project group leader (Patricia) gave us an introduction to what it was, and what it was used for. 
      This was enough information for me to start learning how it works.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I began by going to the DigitalNZ website and looking at their web API documentation. 
      This was very detailed as there were many potential query parameters. 
      The second thing was figuring out exactly what we required for this task. 
      The goal was for the user to be able to type in any search term, and have results with images displayed to our end application.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The DigitalNZ API has two required query parameters: API key and a search term. 
      The API key is acquired by registering online. 
      This allows DigitalNZ to keep track of who is making queries, and block people who are abusing their services. 
      A search term was entered using the parameter ‘text=’. 
      The database would then return any article containing that term.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To reduce the amount of data returned we used an additional parameter to specify that only 10 results per search were required. 
      We also specified that the returned JSON object must have an associated image.
    </p>
    
  <h3>Challenges:</h3>
    <p>
      The hardest part about this task was learning the API’s request structure and putting together a workable URL. 
      At first we didn’t include the ‘per_page’ and image category constraints, meaning we had thousands of results for each request. 
      After reading through the documentation more thoroughly, we found that we could use the constraints to our advantage.
    </p>
    
  <h3>Choosen Solution:</h3>
    <p>
      We successfully created a URL for DigitalNZ that returns the results we wanted. 
      We were able to make this url customisable in the C# app we created, so users can specify the search term.
    </p>
    
  <h3>What I learnt:</h3>
    <p>
      This was the very first task of Project 1, so really the very first time the team and I had to work independently without large influence from a lecturer. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Time management was an essential skill that I improved upon during this task. 
      With no specified class or study time, I had to work on this task in my own scheduled time frames. 
      This meant I had to plan ahead, to give myself enough time to complete the task to a sufficient standard. 
      It was the perfect task to improve my time management skills because the learning curve was not incredibly steep, so if I made a mistake I had time to correct that.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I learnt was how to study a topic efficiently. 
        My preferred learning resource before this task was online tutorials, and Youtube or Lynda video tutorials. 
        Although this was a good way to learn how to complete the task, it took up a lot of time because the tutorials often contained a lot of information that was not required for my task. 
        As the task progressed, I noticed a shift in my learning methods towards using textbooks and the official documentation to get the specific information I required. 
        This increased my study efficiency, so I became more productive and was able to move forwards faster in the task at hand.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        APIs were an exciting new tool to learn to work with. 
        I had never used one, or really knew much about them, however I could immediately see their value and potential in IT development. 
        An API allows you to request data in a format that is accessible to many programming languages, the data can be in JSON format which is light weight and low bandwidth. 
        It is also highly customisable allowing the API developer to choose exactly what can be returned to the user. 
        You can also add things such as authentication to stop attacks on your site or block specific users. 
        I feel like this task inspired me to learn more about application backends and how they are put together.
