  <h2>Communication Skills:</h2>
    <p>
      Communication skills are fundamental in all interactions. 
      Whether it is talking to your friends and family, talking with a work colleague, giving a presentation, or getting specs from a client, efficient and clear communication can drastically change the outcome. 
      Coming into project 1 I considered my communication skills to be one of my strongest talents, as I often had to talk to complete strangers about personal issues in my previous line of work. 
      What I found however is that this is just a small aspect of the overall communication spectrum. 
      In order to succeed in project we had to communicate clearly in a number of areas.

    <h3><Communication with my project group</h3>
    <p>
      At the start of semester, my group consisted of seven students each with different backgrounds and skill sets. 
      This meant that we often had to make decisions together, even when not everyone had the same solution in mind. 
      We decide to make decisions based on democratic principles. 
      We would discuss the pros and cons of each solution, before voting on the most preferred. 
      I found that this system worked well because it gave everyone a chance to discuss their ideas, and occasionally the decided-on solution was a combination of ideas, or an idea that stemmed from another.

      We were often not all in the same room together. 
      This meant that we required a way to communicate from a distance. 
      We decided on using the Slack App as our primary source of distance communication. 
      This worked well because everyone was already using Slack for Polytech chat. Slack gives us the ability to pin important messages or documents, so they don’t get lost amongst the rest of the chat. 
      It also gives us the means to talk on private channels, so we don’t clog up the main chat with general messages.

      One of the greatest communication challenges I faced was when one member of our group stopped attending meetings and communicating on Slack. 
      We initially gave him the benefit of the doubt, and continued pushing forwards with the hope that communication would improve. 
      Unfortunately, the opposite occurred and communication got worse until it stopped all together. 
      I found this situation very hard, as I had no idea what was happening with this team member. 
      I did not want to push an answer out of him in case he was having personal troubles at home, yet I knew that if things did not improve, our group could not move forward as expected. 
      We discussed this as a group during one of our meetings and decided to elevate the issue to our team leader. 
      From there the issue was handled by staff. This was a very difficult situation for myself and for my group to deal with. 
      What I have learnt from this is that there is only so much within one’s power to do. 
      Sometimes an issue needs to be elevated to someone who has the appropriate authority to assess the situation and come to a solution. 
      I also learnt that face to face communication is better in this sort of situation. 
      Tone, facial expression, and body gestures can convey a lot of information to someone you are speaking to. 
      Without these, the meaning of a message can be lost in translation, and you risk making the situation worse.
