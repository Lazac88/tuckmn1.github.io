  <h2>Communication Skills:</h2>
    <p>
      Communication skills are fundamental in all interactions. 
      Whether it is talking to your friends and family, talking with a work colleague, giving a presentation, or getting specs from a client, efficient and clear communication can drastically change the outcome. 
      Coming into project 1 I considered my communication skills to be one of my strongest talents, as I often had to talk to complete strangers about personal issues in my previous line of work. 
      What I found however is that this is just a small aspect of the overall communication spectrum. 
      In order to succeed in project we had to communicate clearly in a number of areas.
    </p>
    <h3>Communication with my project group</h3>
    <p>
      At the start of semester, my group consisted of seven students each with different backgrounds and skill sets. 
      This meant that we often had to make decisions together, even when not everyone had the same solution in mind. 
      We decide to make decisions based on democratic principles. 
      We would discuss the pros and cons of each solution, before voting on the most preferred. 
      I found that this system worked well because it gave everyone a chance to discuss their ideas, and occasionally the decided-on solution was a combination of ideas, or an idea that stemmed from another.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were often not all in the same room together. 
      This meant that we required a way to communicate from a distance. 
      We decided on using the Slack App as our primary source of distance communication. 
      This worked well because everyone was already using Slack for Polytech chat. Slack gives us the ability to pin important messages or documents, so they don’t get lost amongst the rest of the chat. 
      It also gives us the means to talk on private channels, so we don’t clog up the main chat with general messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the greatest communication challenges I faced was when one member of our group stopped attending meetings and communicating on Slack. 
      We initially gave him the benefit of the doubt, and continued pushing forwards with the hope that communication would improve. 
      Unfortunately, the opposite occurred and communication got worse until it stopped all together. 
      I found this situation very hard, as I had no idea what was happening with this team member. 
      I did not want to push an answer out of him in case he was having personal troubles at home, yet I knew that if things did not improve, our group could not move forward as expected. 
      We discussed this as a group during one of our meetings and decided to elevate the issue to our team leader. 
      From there the issue was handled by staff. This was a very difficult situation for myself and for my group to deal with. 
      What I have learnt from this is that there is only so much within one’s power to do. 
      Sometimes an issue needs to be elevated to someone who has the appropriate authority to assess the situation and come to a solution. 
      I also learnt that face to face communication is better in this sort of situation. 
      Tone, facial expression, and body gestures can convey a lot of information to someone you are speaking to. 
      Without these, the meaning of a message can be lost in translation, and you risk making the situation worse.
    </p>
    <h3>Communication with clients</h3>
	<p>
		This was a very important part of our project. 
		It was a rocky start as a majority of the group was unwilling to start communicating early in the semester while we were still getting to grips with the project. 
		The first client we needed to meet was an Occupational Therapist looking at IT solutions to visual impairment therapy after brain injury. 
		Our first mode of communication with her was email. It was my job to draft the formally worded email to be sent to her. 
		I drew on my experience of communicating with health professional to write the draft. 
		This was a good learning experience as it had been several years since I last had to do that. 
		We arranged a meeting with this client in our project room with the entire team. 
		When we first started discussing her IT needs we found that she was unsure of what was possible. 
		We asked her to describe the tool she had in mind, and the specifics that were required. 
		Some of the specs included: easy to set up, an all in one application, for use on an android tablet, results output, and a simple user interface. 
		A challenge of this meeting was getting the client to focus on exactly what she required. 
		She had a broad idea, but getting to the end solution was difficult. 
		She required guidance on what was possible, what device/devices would be easiest to use with her patients, and whether the application was going to be an objective measure tool for Occupational Therapists to use, or a home-based treatment tool for the patients to use, or both. 
		I learnt a lot about translating from health terminology, to layman’s, to IT terminology and back again. 
		It was a very interesting multidisciplinary cross over. 
		I have a much better appreciation of how much IT can help in the healthcare industry.
	</p>
    
  <h2>Team Work:</h2>
	<p>
		To produce a high-quality piece of software requires a dedicated team, who can work together and adapt to changing technology, and client needs. 
		My Community Software project group is comprised of some very skilled people, which makes working with them enjoyable, while also being educational. 
		I have noticed that as this semester progresses my group continues to become stronger as we learn to work better together and understand each other’s strengths. 
		There are multiple reasons why we continue to improve:
	</p>
	<h3>Division of Labour:</h3>
	<p>
		Breaking a big problem down into manageable chunks, and then assigning task to each group member was quite a challenge at first. 
		My whole group did not have much experience in looking at a problem, and knowing how to break it down into the base components. 
		Luckily our team leader gave us guidance and examples over our first few tasks. 
		I can now understand why this is such an important part of software design. 
		Not only does it give you an idea of how to start and approach a problem, it is almost a step by step guide as to what you need to do to finish the piece of software you are working on. 
		It also allows the team to all be working on a different part, but still moving towards the end software.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Cooperation:</h3>
	<p>
		Every member of our group had a different skill set. 
		At first it was difficult to know what each member should be doing. 
		However, as the semester progressed we became more comfortable and confident in our roles, and understood each other’s strengths. 
		This was an important part of our growth as a group, and allowed us to complete tasks more quickly that we would have otherwise. 
		I was also a good opportunity to learn from other group members.
	</p>
  
  <h2>Learning Skills:</h2>
	<p>
		At the beginning of project, my ability to go out and learn a new skill was only at a basic level. 
		I relied heavily on online video tutorials and lecture notes. 
		I tended to avoid the official documentation because I found it intimidating and hard to understand. 
		This meant that the time it took me to find a solution to a problem, was often much more than it needed to be.
	</p>
	<h3>Official Documentation:</h3>
	<p>
		There is a lot of information online that describes how to do something. 
		The most reliable and up to date information is generally the official documentation for that tool. 
		I found that these docs are mostly designed for reference for people who regularly use the tool. 
		When I looked at them, I struggled to understand their meaning. 
		It was only as I became more familiar with the language/framework that the docs started saving time. 
		For example, I had to learn the Django REST API early in the semester. 
		I had no previous experience in using Django, or in working with APIs. 
		Therefore, when I first looked at the documentation it made little sense to me. 
		As I learnt more about Django and APIs the documentation then started to become more and more valuable to me. 
		My conclusion from this is that I shouldn’t avoid looking at the documentation if I don’t understand it. 
		I should always go there first to try and find a solution. 
		The more I expose myself to this type of information, the easier it will be in the future.
	</p>
	<h3>Working With My Project Team:</h3>
	<p>
		Another valuable learning tool I have found while doing project is working with my fellow project members. 
		Each person in my group has a different way of approaching a problem, and seeing them use these approaches has been an invaluable learning tool. 
		It was surprising how many times a few of us have been stuck on a similar problem, yet when we combined what we have done the solution becomes apparent. 
		Having worked in groups in the past that did not perform as well as my current group, has given me a great appreciation for my current project members. 
		It has also given me a better understanding of how good team dynamics work in an IT environment, and how any future groups I am part of could be run.
	</p>
  
  <h2>Time Management:</h2>
	<p>
		To complete tasks our group work in sprints. 
		Each sprint was of a defined time based on how long we expected the task to take. 
		During each sprint we met three times weekly, once for a scrum where we discussed the tasks that needed doing, and who was doing them, and twice for stand-ups, where we looked at the group members progress and challenges.
	</p>
	<p>
		That was the basic structure we used to ensure that our group was progressing and the task was going to get completed by the end of the sprint. 
		Between our meetings it was up to the group member to assign time to complete the components for the task.
	</p>
	<h3>Challenges With Time Management:</h3>
	<p>
		The thing I have found most challenging with doing project is that I am completing three other third year papers at the same time. 
		Each paper is very demanding with home-based exercises, and I find that to complete them to the standard I want means sacrificing time elsewhere. 
		Outside of study I also must balance work, sport, and social commitments. 
		What normally gave out was my social commitments, meaning I was not taking any time for myself. 
		This lead to me quickly burning myself out and falling into an unpleasant head space. 
		What I have learnt from this is that I push myself too hard, and trying to maintain the standards that I have set for myself can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle. 
		The changes I have made in the latter half of semester have helped to improve this. 
		I am now giving myself regular breaks from study, ensuring I exercise multiple times per week, and trying to not put so much pressure on myself in regards to results. 
		When I burn myself out, I become much less productive, which in turn leads to slower study thus more time committed to it, and thus even further burn out. 
		I hope to carry this lesson with me into project 2.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another learning curve with project was that we had no assigned project time slot. 
		Instead we had to schedule time to work on the task at hand. 
		I found the first few weeks ok, but as the tasks became more time demanding, I had to make sure I put in the time to get them done. 
		I learnt that I had to schedule myself dedicated time slots to work on project tasks. 
		If I didn’t, I wouldn’t get enough time to complete the task to my standards.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		My time management skills have increased a lot this semester. 
		This is thanks to a heavy schedule, and having to work independently on project tasks. 
		I will be able to take this skill into the work place, to better manage whatever workload comes my way.
